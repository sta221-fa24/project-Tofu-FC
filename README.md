# Poisonous Mushroom Classification

by Tofu FC

## Summary

Our project investigates how physical features and environmental factors can help distinguish between poisonous and edible wild mushrooms to reduce mushroom poisoning incidents. Using logistic regression, we found that traits such as gill color, cap shape, cap diameter, and interactions between habitat and season are significant predictors of toxicity, with larger caps and winter season reducing the odds of toxicity. While the model achieved a sensitivity of 95% and an AUC of 0.797, it faced limitations like high false positive rates, sparse data for rare characteristics, and multicollinearity, which affected predictor reliability. Future improvements include expanding the dataset, exploring non-linear models like random forests for better classification, and integrating the findings into mobile apps or public health initiatives to promote safer foraging practices.
