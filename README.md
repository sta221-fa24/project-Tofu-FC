# Poisonous Mushroom Classification

by Tofu FC

## Summary

Mushrooms are a valuable food source across cultures, but some species can be poisonous and harmful, prompting our research to investigate how physical features and environmental factors can help distinguish between poisonous and edible wild mushrooms using the UCI mushroom dataset. Using logistic regression on easily observable characteristics like gill color, cap shape, cap diameter, and interactions between habitat and season, we found these traits to be significant predictors of toxicity, with larger caps and winter season reducing the odds of toxicity. While our final model achieved a sensitivity of 95% and an AUC of 0.797, it faced limitations such as high false positive rates, sparse data for rare characteristics, and multicollinearity, which affected predictor reliability. Future improvements include expanding the dataset, exploring non-linear models like random forests for better classification, and integrating the findings into mobile apps or public health initiatives to promote safer foraging practices.
